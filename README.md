# 🧠 Credit Risk Prediction App

A machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of a loan default based on applicant information. The backend model is trained using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**, with thorough preprocessing and feature engineering.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to evaluate the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project includes:

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features
- Model training using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
- Deployment via Streamlit with real-time prediction

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Two ML models**: Logistic Regression (interpretable) & XGBoost (robust performance)
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Label Encoding, Scaling, Null handling
- 🧠 **Interactive UI**: Takes user input and returns prediction
- 🧮 **Confidence Score**: Model outputs probability of default
- 📂 **Batch prediction** (optional, if added later)
