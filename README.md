## 📌 Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to evaluate the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project includes:

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features
- Model training using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
- Deployment via Streamlit with real-time prediction
