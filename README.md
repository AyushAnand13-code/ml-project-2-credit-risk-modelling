# ðŸ§  Credit Risk Prediction App

A machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of a loan default based on applicant information. The backend model is trained using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**, with thorough preprocessing and feature engineering.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to evaluate the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project includes:

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features
- Model training using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
- Deployment via Streamlit with real-time prediction

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“Š **Two ML models**: Logistic Regression (interpretable) & XGBoost (robust performance)
- ðŸ§¹ **Data Preprocessing**: Label Encoding, Scaling, Null handling
- ðŸ§  **Interactive UI**: Takes user input and returns prediction
